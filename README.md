# JavaTime
I'm learning Java. Here's some programs I made. 

## Dict.java
Status: âœ…

Challenge:
```
Tell Java to return the minimum value and maximum value for each: 
int, byte, short, long, float, double, boolean
```

## Rev.java
Status: âœ… 

Challenge: 
```
Tell Java to reverse the order of words in any given sentence of any given length.
```
Note: This was my first swing at a program that reads an input sentence and returns the words in reverse order. 

## Rev2.java
Status: âœ… 

Challenge: 
```
Tell Java to reverse the order of words in any given sentence of any given length.
```
Note: This is the final version of the the reverser. Instead it uses a method which can take user input from the command line it is running in. 

## Scanner.java
Status: âœ… 

Challenge: 
```
For a given user input, convert that input from lbs to kg. 
```

## TomRiddler.java
Status: ðŸš«

Challenge:
```
For any 2 user input strings, return true if they are anagrams, return false if they are not anagrams. 
```
