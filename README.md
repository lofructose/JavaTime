# JavaTime
I'm learning Java. Here's some programs I made. 

## Dict.java
This program returns the min and max values of primitive types in Java. 

## Rev.java
This was my first swing at a program that reads an input sentence and returns the words in reverse order. 

## Rev2.java
This is the final version of the the reverser. Instead it uses a method which can take user input from the command line it is running in. 

## Scanner.java
This was how I learned how to read command line input. This app takes a number in lbs and converts it to kgs.
